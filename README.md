# Sentinel 

Tool for Twitch channel moderation

Hello guys
I'm Renato, this is my first tool for Twitch.tv, I hope this tool helps you as well.
Sentinel is a message reader when you are streaming or not, he let your chat keep in our storage and when you need to Audit any message what your viewers sent, you can do this on our website.

This tool doesn't have to be paid or anything, I made this to help the community, but if you want to buy a coffee for me you can donate on Paypal.

Enjoy it!
